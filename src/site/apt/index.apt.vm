Subversion Authentication Parser Module

  The idea is to read the
  {{{http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn-book.html#svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz}Subversion authentication file}}
  and convert it into a object tree which can be used
  for applications and to handle their permissions.

* History

  The original idea for this module based upon the {{{http://supose.org/wiki/supose}SupoSE project}}
  which reads the contents of the whole repository but has to limit
  the results of queries to the appropriate information which are
  allowed for particular users.

* Usage

  If you like to use the Subversion Authentication Parser Module (SAPM)
  inside your application the simplest way is (if you are using {{{http://maven.pache.org}Maven}})
  to define the dependency in your
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html}pom.xml}}
  and use the classes of the module otherwise you have to download the jar
  file and put it into your classpath.
